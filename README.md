# LDS Ward Callings

If you are an LDS Ward Clerk or Bishopric member you may have the need to view all the members of the ward and their callings.
This Python 3 code pulls the data that you are authorized to view from lds.org via the offical API and then formats it, builds some html pages and writes a PDF document for printing.

## Getting Started

For now you will need to use the run the Python code and install the needed libraries.

If it is not clear to you how to do this, my code my not be of help to you. I am interested in making this more accessable so add an issue and if I have the time I'll try and explain better and add to this README.

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3
