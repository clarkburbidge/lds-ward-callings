# lds-ward-callings
Display all the callings for an LDS Ward by organization.

If you an LDS Ward Clerk or Bishopric member you may have the need to view all the members of the ward and their callings.
This Python 3 code pulls the data that you are authorized to view form lds.org via the offical API and then formats it, builds some html pages and writes a PDF document for printing.
